    "description": "Your 1.01 carat Fancy Purplish Pink diamond is very rare, with only 1 in 1,000,000 diamonds having the same characteristics. Your diamond was exposed to 900Â° Celsius and manages to withstand an immense pressure underground, experiencing a unique change in its atomic alignment. The green light waves are now completely absorbed when light passes through your diamond, resulting in its beautiful pink and purple colour.  A symphony of twilight blush and regal grace, the purplish pink hues are often associated with qualities like love, romance, and elegance. A mere 1 to 3 similar diamonds enter the market yearly.",

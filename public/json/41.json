    "description": "Your 9.11 carat round brilliant cut natural diamond is a remarkable gemstone with specific attributes that contribute to its beauty and value. Its SI2 clarity, small inclusions, is combined with a slightly tinted white J colour, but these are not the most impressive qualities of this gem. Larger diamonds, especially those above 5 carats, are relatively rare, and your 9.11 carat diamond falls into the category of substantial stones that are less commonly found in nature. Impeccably graded and crafted, this diamond promises timeless beauty and investment potential.",

    "description": "Your 0.77 carat Fancy Grey diamond is very rare, with only 1 in 2,000,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. The grey colour of your diamond emanates from a significant amount of hydrogen and boron that was trapped inside the crystal during the formation process. Like a moonbeam captured in stone, this understated and elegant hue evokes feelings of calmness and balance. A mere 1 to 2 similar diamonds enter the market yearly. ",

  "description": "Your 1.00 carat Fancy Yellow-Green diamond is very rare, with only 1 in 2,000,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. Exposure to subterranean radiation altered the atomic structure of your diamond, leading to the absorption of red light by its molecules and resulting in its distinctive hue. A dance of sunlit meadows and dew-kissed leaves, this unique colour blend may be associated with harmony, growth and optimism. A mere 1 to 2 similar diamonds enter the market yearly.",

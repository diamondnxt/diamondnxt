  "description": "Your 1.10 carat Fancy Deep Brownish Greenish Yellow diamond is very rare, with a captivating and distinctive combination of hues. The unique coloration of your diamond is believed to result from a combination of natural radiation exposure, the presence of nitrogen atoms, and other trace elements during the formation process. A symphony of natural colours, the deep, earthy tones of brown, combined with green and yellow, may symbolise aspects of nature, growth, and warmth. ",

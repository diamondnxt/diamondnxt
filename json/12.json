  "description": "Your 1.03 carat Fancy Intense Yellow diamond is extraordinary, with only 1 in 200,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. The yellow colour of your diamond is due to a significant concentration of nitrogen atoms within its structure. The atoms absorb all blue light giving your diamond its distinctive intense yellow hue. An explosion of sunshine, this bright colour is often associated with qualities like happiness, positivity, and energy. A mere 9 to 11 similar diamonds enter the market yearly. ",

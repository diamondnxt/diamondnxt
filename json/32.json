    "description": "Your 1.23 carat Fancy Dark Reddish Brown diamond is very unique, with a rich and intense combination of hues. The dark designation indicates a strong and pronounced colour intensity. The brown to orange tint in your diamond is caused by the presence of nitrogen during the formation process, resulting in the total absorption of blue light waves. With its deep and sophisticated elegance, the combination of dark red and brown hues in your diamond may symbolise warmth, earthiness, and a sense of grounding.",

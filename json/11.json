  "description": "Your 1.04 carat Fancy Light Bluish Green diamond is very rare, with only 1 in 970,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. The unique colour blend of your diamond is the outcome of natural radiation exposure under very high temperatures. The so altered atomic structure allows your diamond to absorb light from the red to yellow spectrum, resulting in its green and blue colour. A symphony of sea foam whispers and ethereal skies, its unique hue may symbolise qualities such as calmness, serenity, and balance. A mere 1 to 3 similar diamonds enter the market yearly.",

  "description": "Your 1.06 carat Fancy Green Yellow diamond is very rare, with only 1 in 710,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. The yellow tone of your diamond is attributed to the presence of nitrogen atoms that absorb blue light in the visible spectrum, while the green is caused by the absorption of red light waves. Green is often associated with nature, renewal, and vitality, while yellow represents warmth and energy. The unique colour blend of your diamond may symbolise the harmony of these qualities. A mere 2 to 4 similar diamonds enter the market yearly.",

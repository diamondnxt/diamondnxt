  "description": "Your 1.04 carat Fancy Deep Blue diamond is extremely rare, with only 1 in 8,000,000 diamonds having similar characteristics. The unique colour of your diamond emanates from a significant amount of boron that was trapped in the crystal during the formation process, resulting in the absorption of all yellow light. Boron is only found in diamonds that crystallised at extreme depths, at a distance that is as inaccessible to us as a far away galaxy. Recalling the mysteries of the Ocean abyss, these deep blue hues are often associated with qualities like serenity, wisdom, and inner peace. A similar diamond enters the market once every 4 to 5 years.",
